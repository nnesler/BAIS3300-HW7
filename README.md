#Description of the project:

#In this project I decided to take a survey involving students preferences around Iowa City. I want to learn about what campus buildings, coffee shops and bars/restaurants students prefer. 



#Best Practives

#I started off by making this survey accessible to all UIowa students. A practice I started with was making the survey very clear who it was intended to be for. I included a Hawkeye logo and state that it is for UIowa students. I also used large enough text sizes for everyone to be able to read all. Using text everyone can read is a best practice to make sure everyone can be included in the survey. 

#The next best practice I completed was following the "if you don't need it, don't collect it". For my survey I had no need to collect data on race or ethnicity. I felt it would not benefit my data collection or help me draw any conclusions. Making idividuals feel like they are being judged based on their race unessearily is bad practice so I chose to leave it out. 

#The next best practice I implemented was the color contrast. I made sure to avoide any colors that would made the survey hard to read. I used black on white (21:1 ratio). I felt as though the pictures brought enough pop to the survey and I didnt think I needed any other colors as distractions. 

#The final best practice I completed was offering many options for the gender selection. I offered male, female, non binary and prefer not to answer. Being inclusive for people to have the choice of the gender they identify with is important. I made sure to use the checkbox format in case someone identfies with multiple genders.
